# Winston Logger

## Nodemon

```
start: nodemon --inspect --watch app --ext js .
```

* --inspect - a great way to debug a running project. Open up the chrome browser and set the URL to chrome://inspect
*  --watch <path> - specify the folders to monitor for file changes.
*  --ext or -e - a comma delimeted list of extensions to monitor. This is a great way to prevent restarts when saving json files.

<br>

> An alternative to this is to use a [config](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md) file.

### Restarting

Another way to restart is to type `rs` and hit enter in the console.
